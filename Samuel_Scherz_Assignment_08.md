# Plant communities on nitrogen‐rich soil are less sensitive to soil moisture than plant communities on nitrogen‐poor soil

## Introduction 

As of recent I've been interested in agricultural science, and how soil nutrition affects plant life. However, I've found that soil data and plots are often quite hard to interpret as a biologist. I'm interested in _Shovon et al 2019_ because it's an attempt to explain an ecological phenomenon using a combination of soil and plant trait data, but I feel that the paper's conclusions in writing are not supported by their visuals. How can I logically manipulate this data to reach the same conclusion as the paper, but with visuals that anyone can easily interpret? 

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed
The study of how different plant species interact with one another and persist in a specific ecosystem is known as **plant community ecology**. While heterotroph survival is largely governed by the ability to consume organic life forms,  The survival and reproductive capability of primary producers in an ecosystem depends on environmental conditions, such as **light quality**, **soil moisture**, and **soil nutrients**. Previous studies have discovered that species composition and diversity within plant communities are affected if any one of the three previously listed resources are limited. _Shovon et al 2019_ investigated if plant communities limited in one of these essential resources were more sensitive to the limitation of another resource. I'm curious as to how the authors found that _plant communities on nitrogen‐rich soil are less sensitive to soil moisture than plant communities on nitrogen‐poor soil_, because their created plots don't provide a convincing conclusion. 


All of the data labels are clarified within the [original publication](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2745.13251?casa_token=l8SmnRyQ9AwAAAAA%3AuiMyvl5y48ihlPk6WBjhL6MlQGf2vqFOrRkua3U4sSrHmsehn168saMTbaGtlzihORdLvtW0Q5YwMJQ). Each **row** of data in the dataset is an experimental understory plot  in Cypress hills National Forest, Sasketchewan. The **columns** are grouped into 3 categories: Environmental Variables, Community Weighted Means, and Functional Dispersion. There were eight environmental variables measured at each plot: **% of rocks to soil**, **% canopy openness**, **% sand**, **% silt**, and  **% clay** (soil type), **soil C/N ratio**, **soil PH**, and **soil moisture**. However the significant results of the study were only correlated with soil moisture and soil C/N ratio, so I'll only be using those variables in my recreation. The response variables were all measured trait values (like leaf area etc...) of different species of plants in the plot, which may all be used to support the effects of soil moisture and soil C/N ratios. 

A confusing aspect of this data is that each recorded plant trait value in the dataset is the mean trait value of all species measured in a certain plot,  weighted by the proportion of each species in the plot (hard to visualize right?) known as the **Community Weighted Mean**. These community weighted mean values and **Functional Dispersion** values are the main ways of quantifying the response of these plant communities to environmental change. Functional dispersion in this case is a measure of if a plant community is mainly investing their traits values towards an **acquisitive strategy** (optimizing fast growth and nutrient uptake), or a **conservative strategy**(optimizing efficient water and nutrient uptake). Changes in community weighted mean and functional dispersion values due to a change in an environmental variable indicate a plant community's sensitivity to that environmental variable. 

Once you understand this logic and reasoning behind the "manipulated" data values in this set, making the graphs should be quite easy. Our two treatments are **understory plots with a soil C/N ratio close to 15** and **understory plots with a soil C/N ratio close to 30. ** by making soil moisture our x-axis, we should be able to see if these two treatments respond differently to soil moisture, and hopefully reach the same conclusion as the authors of the paper.
